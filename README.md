Before You Continue
===================
  - The Recent Comments widgets allows you to display recent comments on your PyroCMS site. Very easy to use.
  - This widget assumes you use the PyroCMS blog module  with the default URL format (/blog/YYYY/MM/slug).  I may add variables to handle different types of URL structures if there is demand.

Install
